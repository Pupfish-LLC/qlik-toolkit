## Overview

This skill covers everything users see in Qlik Sense: sheets, charts, filter panes, KPIs, responsive behavior, colors, fonts, and accessibility. It does NOT cover data modeling (qlik-data-modeling), expression authoring (qlik-expressions), or load scripts (qlik-load-script). The key principle: **sheets organize by business workflow (what questions users need answered), NOT by data tables**. The viz architect uses this skill to select chart types, design layouts, configure filters, and catalog reusable patterns from reference apps. The skill emphasizes decision frameworks over specification lists.

## Section 1: Chart Type Selection Decision Framework

Do not choose chart types by guess. Use a decision framework based on the data relationship you're visualizing.

### Data Relationships and Appropriate Charts

**Comparison (How do these categories compare?)**
- **Best choice:** Bar chart (horizontal for long category names), column chart (vertical, especially for time periods), bullet chart (single measure with performance target)
- **Avoid:** Pie and donut charts for comparison. Human eyes cannot accurately compare slice sizes; use bar charts instead (especially for >3 categories)
- **Example:** "Which sales region had highest revenue?" → Horizontal bar chart with regions on Y-axis, revenue on X-axis

**Composition (What parts make up the whole?)**
- **Best choice:** 100% stacked bar/column chart, waterfall chart (shows how total builds/breaks down step-by-step), treemap (hierarchical composition with size encoding)
- **Avoid:** Pie charts (only in specific cases where exactly 2-3 slices and context demands "percent of whole" messaging; generally avoid)
- **Example:** "What departments contribute to total headcount?" → 100% stacked bar chart

**Distribution (How are values spread across a range?)**
- **Best choice:** Histogram (binned frequency distribution), box plot (quartiles and outliers), scatter plot (one measure on each axis showing density)
- **Avoid:** Line charts for non-time distributions
- **Example:** "How are employee salaries distributed across ranges?" → Histogram showing salary buckets and frequency

**Relationship (How do two variables correlate?)**
- **Best choice:** Scatter plot (two measures, optional third as size/color), bubble chart (three measures: X, Y, size), heat map (two dimensions with measure as color)
- **Avoid:** Line charts for non-sequential data relationships
- **Example:** "Does marketing spend correlate with sales revenue?" → Scatter plot with marketing spend (X), revenue (Y)

**Trend (How does a measure change over time?)**
- **Best choice:** Line chart (time on X-axis, trend visible), area chart (trend with magnitude emphasis), combination chart (line for trend + bars for volume)
- **Avoid:** Bar charts for time series (less efficient than line)
- **Example:** "How has monthly revenue trended over the past year?" → Line chart with months on X-axis

### Specialized Chart Types

**KPI object** — Single metric with large font. Use when the metric is critical to user decision, or as dashboard headline. Supports conditional coloring (red/green based on value vs. target), trending indicators (up/down arrows), calculation conditions. Example: "Total Sales YTD" KPI in top-left of executive dashboard.

**Table** — Detailed row-level data. Use when users need exact values, multiple columns from different tables, or custom sorting. Design: limit to ≤15 columns, right-align numbers, add currency symbols, use alternating row background colors for readability.

**Gauge chart** — Circular progress indicator with meaningful maximum (quota, target %). Use sparingly; wastes space compared to KPI for raw numbers. Useful when dashboard space is severely constrained.

**Combo/Combination chart** — Multiple measures with different visualization types (bars + line on dual Y-axes). Design carefully: different Y-axis scales can be misleading. Label clearly which axis each measure uses.

## Section 2: Layout and Information Hierarchy

Apply to sheet design using Qlik Sense's responsive grid system.

### Information Hierarchy Principles

- **Top priority first** — KPIs and headline numbers across top (users scan top-left first), detail analysis below
- **Business workflow sequence** — Organize left-to-right, top-to-bottom in the order users ask questions. Example: "What was revenue?" (KPI top-left) → "What's the trend?" (chart top-middle) → "Which regions contributed?" (bar chart right)
- **One focused object > many small objects** — Avoid visual clutter. Use sheets to separate concerns (executive summary sheet, detail analysis sheet, operational monitoring sheet)
- **Calculation conditions** — Hide objects when data is insufficient. Example: "Show this chart only if Year is selected" prevents showing a meaningless trend when no year filter is applied
- **Whitespace** — Use grid gaps and padding to separate logical groups. Improves readability and reduces cognitive load

### Responsive Grid Behavior

Qlik Sense responsive mode stacks objects vertically on mobile/tablet. Objects in top-left remain visible on all breakpoints; lower-right objects may reflow below fold. Design: ensure single-column layout looks good on mobile. Test: Sheet Editor > Preview > Responsive Preview Mode, then drag window edge to simulate breakpoints.

### Layout Patterns

**Executive Dashboard** — 4-6 KPIs across top row, global filters on right, one large visualization below (trend or comparison), action buttons or drill-through links at bottom.

**Detail Analysis Sheet** — Filters on left side (global or sheet-specific), visualization grid on right. Top-right: high-level overview chart. Bottom-right: drill-down table. Users filter left side and see impact across visualizations.

## Section 3: Color and Formatting Standards

### Color Assignment

- **Static mapping** — Same dimension value always gets the same color across all sheets. Example: "North region is always blue, South always red." Implement via master item color assignment or conditional coloring expressions.
- **Sequential scales** — For ordered numeric data (0-100% completion). Use light-to-dark gradient (white → light blue → dark blue).
- **Diverging scales** — For data with meaningful midpoint (e.g., -50% to +50% variance). Use red (negative) → white (zero) → green (positive).

### Accessibility-Safe Palettes

- **Color blindness** — ~8% of population has color vision deficiency (most common: red-green). Use tested colorblind-friendly palettes (viridis, cividis). When red/green necessary, also use pattern, size, or text labels to differentiate.
- **WCAG AA contrast** — Text must have ≥4.5:1 contrast with background. Test with WebAIM Contrast Checker. Dark text on light background is always safe.
- **Recommended palette** — Blues, oranges, purples (avoid pure red/green combinations unless text labels are added)

### Number, Date, and Field Formatting

- **Currency** — Symbol + 2 decimals: "$1,234.56" (with thousands separator)
- **Percentages** — 1 decimal: "45.2%"
- **Large numbers** — Abbreviated with tooltip: "1.2M" (tooltip shows "1,234,567")
- **Dates** — Consistent format across sheets: "Jan 2024" or ISO format "2024-01-15" (clearer than "01/02/03")
- **Field labels** — Friendly names: "Product Category" not "PROD_CAT". Consistent terminology across sheets.
- **Font sizes** — KPI headline: 48-60pt (readable from distance), chart title: 16-18pt, axis labels: 12-14pt

## Section 4: Filter Design Strategy

### Global Filter Pane (Multi-Sheet)

Use when users need the same filter context across multiple sheets (Year, Region, Department apply to all analyses). Appears in consistent location (typically right pane), selections persist as user navigates sheets. Design: low-cardinality fields as list (Year, Region), high-cardinality (>50 unique values) in search mode (type to narrow list).

### Sheet-Specific Filter Pane

Use when filter applies only to one or two sheets (example: "Product Detail Filter" for product analysis only). Reduce cognitive load by hiding irrelevant filters. Embed filter objects on the sheet itself, above visualizations.

### Alternative States for Comparative Analysis

Allow multiple independent filter contexts on the same sheet. Use for "Budget vs. Actual" or "This Year vs. Last Year" comparisons. Define states in app settings, create separate filter and visualization sets per state. Caution: increases complexity; use only when comparing is core workflow.

### Field Selection for Filters

| Cardinality | Mode | Example |
|---|---|---|
| ≤20 values | List (checkboxes) | Region (4 regions) |
| 21-50 values | List with scroll | Sales Rep (30 reps) |
| >50 values | Search mode | Product SKU (10,000 SKUs) |
| Time | Button group or calendar | Monthly data → button group; Daily → calendar picker |

## Section 5: Responsive Design Patterns

### Qlik Sense Responsive Grid

Fluid grid with breakpoints: Desktop (≥1200px), Tablet (768-1199px), Mobile (<768px). Objects reflow vertically on narrower screens. Responsive mode enabled per sheet: Sheet Settings > Layout > Responsive Mode.

### Design for Responsive

- **Priority objects** — Top-left objects remain visible across breakpoints. Lower-right objects reflow below fold on mobile.
- **Single-column layout** — Ensure objects look good stacked vertically. Not too tall, readable fonts.
- **Object sizing** — Use auto-width/height; avoid fixed pixels that break on mobile.
- **Filter pane behavior** — Collapses to hamburger menu on mobile, appears as full-screen overlay when opened.
- **What to hide on mobile** — Decorative objects, secondary reference charts, wide tables. Use Responsive Visibility settings to hide below breakpoint.

### Testing

Sheet Editor > Preview > Responsive Preview Mode. Drag preview edge to simulate breakpoints. Check: text readability, object visibility, no horizontal scroll at each breakpoint.

## Section 6: Accessibility Best Practices

### Color Accessibility

- **Color blindness-safe palettes** — Use tested palettes (viridis, cividis). When color alone distinguishes data, add pattern, shape, or text label. Example: don't just color bars red/green; also label "On Track" / "Off Track".
- **WCAG AA contrast** — ≥4.5:1 contrast required. Dark text on light background is always safe. Colored backgrounds need testing (WebAIM Contrast Checker).

### Screen Reader Considerations

- **Chart titles and labels** — Required; screen readers announce titles and axis labels for context.
- **Table headers** — Properly marked so screen readers announce column names.
- **Alt text** — For embedded images or logos, describe content: "Company branding logo".
- **Avoid color-only encoding** — Red means "problem", green means "good"? Also use text labels or icons so color-blind users understand.

### Label Clarity

- **Every axis and legend** must be clearly labeled. Don't assume users know "MTD" or "YTD"; spell out or use tooltips.
- **Measurement units** — "Sales (Millions)" not just "Sales". Include units in data labels where relevant.
- **Calculation conditions** — When object is hidden due to condition, display message: "Select Year to view this chart" instead of blank space.

## Section 7: Reference App Pattern Reverse-Engineering

To replicate design patterns from existing Qlik apps, systematically examine sheet structure, object types, filter strategy, colors, layout, and responsive behavior. Document findings in a pattern catalog for reuse in new projects.

**See `reference-app-patterns.md` for the detailed 9-step reverse-engineering procedure, pattern catalog template, and replication checklist.**
