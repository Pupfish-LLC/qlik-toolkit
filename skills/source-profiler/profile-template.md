# Source Profile Template

Use this template to manually profile data sources when MCP connections are not available. Complete one section per table. Use your database tools (SQL Server Management Studio, pgAdmin, DBeaver, etc.) to gather the required information.

**Instructions:**
1. For each source table, copy the table template below and fill in the values.
2. Row count: Execute `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [TableName]`
3. Cardinality per column: Execute `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT [ColumnName]) FROM [TableName]` (or `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ColumnName) FROM TableName` for unquoted names)
4. Null rate: Execute `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [TableName] WHERE [ColumnName] IS NULL` and divide by row count
5. Sample values: Execute `SELECT DISTINCT [ColumnName] FROM [TableName] LIMIT 5` (adjust LIMIT as needed; different databases use different syntax)
6. Data types: Query the database system catalog (INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS for SQL databases, etc.)

**Estimated time to complete:** 1-2 hours for a typical 10-20 table source, depending on table sizes and query performance.

## COMPLETED EXAMPLE: dim_customer

**Copy this as a template for each of your tables. This example is based on a retail data warehouse.**

### Metadata

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Table Name | dim_customer |
| Row Count | 125,400 |
| Primary Key | customer_id |
| Key Uniqueness | Confirmed unique (SELECT COUNT(*), COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) both return 125,400) |
| Refresh Pattern | Full refresh nightly (entire table reloaded) |

### Architectural Classification

| Classification | Value |
|---|---|
| Role | Dimension (slowly-changing dimension) |
| Key Structure | Surrogate key (customer_id is auto-increment integer) with business key (email is unique account identifier) |
| Mutability | SCD Type 2 (attributes overwritten, effective_from / effective_to versioning) |
| Incremental Load Pattern | Full refresh (no incremental approach; entire dimension reloaded nightly) |
| Consumption Implication | Load surrogate key as association to fact tables. Join on customer_id. Filter for is_current=1 when modeling current customer state. Handle historical versions with dual timestamp or version flag. |

### Column Inventory

| Column Name | Data Type | Cardinality | Null % | Min | Max | Sample Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| customer_id | INT | 125,400 | 0% | 1 | 125,400 | [1, 50000, 125400] | Auto-increment primary key, never null |
| email | VARCHAR(100) | 125,350 | 0.04% | [null] | [z@example.com] | [alice@example.com, bob@example.com, charlie@example.com] | Business key, almost unique (few duplicates). Some records have null email. |
| customer_name | VARCHAR(100) | ~110,000 | 2% | [null] | [Zoe Smith] | [Alice Johnson, Bob Williams, Charlie Brown] | Full name. ~2,500 nulls (legacy records). Average length 25 characters. |
| customer_segment | VARCHAR(50) | 5 | 0% | [null] | [Premium] | [Standard, Premium, VIP, Inactive, New] | Status values only. No nulls. Used for RLS. |
| created_date | DATE | ~2000 | 0% | 2015-01-01 | 2026-03-01 | [2015-03-15, 2020-06-20, 2025-11-10] | Customer acquisition date. No nulls. Earliest customer from 2015. |
| effective_from | DATE | ~2000 | 0% | 2015-01-01 | 2026-03-01 | [2015-03-15, 2020-06-20, 2025-11-10] | SCD Type 2 versioning start date. Matches created_date for first version. |
| effective_to | DATE | ~2000 | 15% | 2016-01-01 | 2026-03-01 | [2016-04-30, 2022-08-15, 2025-12-31] | SCD Type 2 versioning end date. Null for current versions (is_current=1). ~18,810 records have null effective_to. |
| is_current | TINYINT | 2 | 0% | 0 | 1 | [0, 1] | Flag: 1 = current version, 0 = historical. Use to filter to current state. |
| address | VARCHAR(200) | ~120,000 | 5% | [null] | [Zoe Way, ...] | [123 Main St, 456 Oak Ave, 789 Pine Rd] | Mutable field. Changes captured by SCD2. ~6,270 nulls. |
| city | VARCHAR(50) | ~8,000 | 2% | [null] | [Zoe City] | [New York, Los Angeles, Chicago] | City name. ~2,508 nulls. |
| state | VARCHAR(2) | 52 | 1% | [null] | [ZZ] | [NY, CA, TX] | US state code. ~1,254 nulls (international addresses). 50 states plus DC and military codes. |
| country | VARCHAR(50) | 3 | 0% | [null] | [USA] | [USA, Canada, Mexico] | Country. Only 3 distinct values. No nulls. |
| phone | VARCHAR(20) | ~120,000 | 10% | [null] | [999-999-9999] | [555-0100, 555-0200, 555-0300] | Phone number. ~12,540 nulls. Multiple formats observed. |

### Data Quality Flags

- **Null handling:** Several columns have nulls (email 0.04%, customer_name 2%, address 5%, phone 10%). Null rate is reasonable; no fields have excessive nulls (>50%).
- **String encoding:** No string-encoded nulls detected (e.g., 'null' as text). Actual NULL values used.
- **Date consistency:** Dates are consistent DATE type. No mixed format issues.
- **Key integrity:** Primary key is unique and never null. Business key (email) is almost unique (~99.96% unique) but has duplicates; investigate during detailed source profiling detailed profiling.

### Cross-Table Notes

- **Referential Integrity:** dim_customer is a dimension. Expected to have foreign key references from fact_orders (customer_id). Verify in detailed source profiling that all customer_ids in fact_orders exist in dim_customer.
- **SCD Type 2 Handling:** This dimension uses SCD Type 2 (slowly changing dimension, version tracking). Qlik load script must:
  - Load all historical versions (do NOT filter for is_current=1 during load; keep history for time-travel analysis)
  - Join fact tables on customer_id + date association (use effective_from and effective_to to capture which version was current on the order date)
- **Null Handling:** Nulls in address, city, state, phone are legitimate (international records, privacy-opted-out, etc.). Do not treat as data quality issues. Qlik NullAsValue() may be needed for filter panes.
