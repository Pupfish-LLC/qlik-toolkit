## 1. App Inspection Tools

### describe_app
- Safe, read-only metadata call. No significant gotchas.
- Less field detail than `get_fields`. Use `describe_app` for a quick overview, `get_fields` for type-level profiling.

### get_fields
- The `tags` array is the richest metadata source. Key tags to watch for:
  - `$key` — Qlik identified this field as a key (used in associations).
  - `$keypart` — Part of a composite key.
  - `$numeric`, `$text`, `$date`, `$timestamp` — Dual representation indicators.
  - `$ascii` — Text encoding indicator.
- **Does NOT return table membership.** You cannot tell which table a field belongs to from this response alone. That information comes from the load script or data model specification.
- Field names are case-sensitive throughout Qlik. `[Sales.Amount]` and `[sales.amount]` are different fields.

### get_field_values
- `limit` maximum is effectively 99. Requesting 100 may return an error on some tenants.
- Values are returned in Qlik's internal sort order, not alphabetical.
- **Affected by active selections.** If you need the full unfiltered value set, call `clear_selections` first.
- Does not return null counts. Use `create_data_object` with `NullCount()` for null analysis.
- Returns dual representation (text + numeric) for each value.

### search_field_values
- `fieldName` is required per the documented signature: `qlik_search_field_values(fieldName="payment_year", searchTerms=["2022"])`. To scan many fields, iterate the call per field.
- Case-insensitive (practitioner observation, unverified in docs).
- Partial matching (practitioner observation, unverified in docs).
- Numeric search works on the text representation, e.g. "2024" matches the text "2024" (practitioner observation, unverified in docs).

### list_sheets
- **The `cells` array in the response is truncated.** Never rely on it for a complete object inventory. Always follow up with `get_sheet_details` per sheet.

### list_bookmarks / create_bookmark / select_bookmark / delete_bookmark
- `select_bookmark` applies the bookmark's saved filter state to the session and returns the resulting selection state.
- `delete_bookmark` restriction: "You can only delete bookmarks created using Qlik MCP tools." Pre-existing user-created bookmarks cannot be removed via MCP.
- For reference-app analysis, `list_bookmarks` + `select_bookmark` is the cleanest way to reproduce a documented analytical context before extracting chart data.

### get_sheet_details
- Returns object configurations but NOT visual layout coordinates (grid row/column positions).
- Reliable for extracting chart types, dimension/measure assignments, and object IDs.

### list_dimensions / list_measures
- Returns all master (library) items with their definitions, expressions, and IDs.
- The `libraryId` from these responses is what you pass to `add_chart` when referencing master items.

## 2. Data Analytics Tools

### create_data_object
- **Session-scoped (ephemeral).** Objects exist only for the current session and are automatically cleaned up. No manual deletion needed.
- **Silent field name failures.** Referencing `[NonExistent.Field]` returns null/0, not an error. This is the most dangerous gotcha. Always verify field names with `get_fields` before building expressions.
- **Silent value failures in set analysis.** `Sum({<State={'XX'}>} [Amount])` returns 0 when 'XX' doesn't exist, not an error.
- **Label is mandatory for inline expressions.** Omitting `label` when using `expression` causes an error.
- **Label is ignored for library measures.** When using `libraryId`, the library item's label is used regardless of any `label` you provide.
- **Respects active selections.** Use set analysis for one-off filtering instead of `select_values` when you don't want to affect session state.
- **Data returned in first page only for large results.** Use `get_chart_data` with the returned object ID to paginate through larger result sets.
- **10,000 cell limit per request.** Cells = dimensions × measures × rows. Apply sort + limit to constrain high-cardinality dimensions.

### get_chart_data
- Works on both permanent chart objects (on sheets) and session objects (from `create_data_object`).
- The `chartId` for session objects is returned in the `create_data_object` response.
- Data reflects current selection state at time of call.
- Same 10,000 cell limit applies.

### get_chart_info
- Metadata only, no data retrieval. Returns chart type, title, dimensions, measures, total row count.
- Useful for inspecting reference app charts without loading their data.

### select_values
- **Cumulative and persistent.** Each call adds to existing selections. To replace, clear first.
- **Silent failure for non-existent values.** The returned selection list is the ground truth. If the field doesn't appear in it, the selection failed silently.
- **`match` overrides `values`.** If both are provided, only `match` is used.
- **Cannot clear app-level defaults.** Script-embedded selections, Section Access reductions, and default bookmark selections persist even after `clear_selections`.
- Prefer set analysis over selections for single analytical queries to avoid state management overhead.

### clear_selections
- Clears user-applied selections only. App-level defaults persist.
- Returns the actual selection state after clearing (the truth).
- Accepts optional `fieldName` to clear only one field's selections.

### get_current_selections
- Call before any data retrieval to check for unexpected active selections.
- Call after `select_values` to verify selections were applied correctly.

## 3. Visualization Creation Tools

### create_sheet
- Title must be 3-127 characters.
- Creates an empty sheet. Use `add_chart` and `add_filter` to populate it.
- No control over sheet ordering within the app.

### add_chart
- **No positioning control.** Charts are appended sequentially. No way to specify grid row/column.
- **No formatting control.** Colors, number formats, conditional formatting, fonts are not configurable.
- **Expression validation is deferred.** Invalid expressions succeed at chart creation but fail at render time (showing an error in the chart object). Always validate expressions with `create_data_object` first.
- **`label` is mandatory for inline fields/expressions.** Always include `label` when using `field` or `expression` directly (not `libraryId`).
- **Scatterplot requirements:** Despite documentation suggesting 2 dimensions + 1 measure, scatterplots actually work best with 1 dimension + 2-3 measures (X-axis, Y-axis, optional bubble size). Test your specific configuration.

### add_filter
- No control over filter display mode (list, search, dropdown). The Qlik Sense client determines this based on field cardinality.
- No control over positioning within the sheet.

### create_dimension / create_measure
- Name must be 3-127 characters for both.
- Once created, items are available to all sheets in the app.
- **Expression validation does not happen at creation time** for measures. Invalid expressions silently succeed here.
- **MCP-only mutation restriction (server-enforced):** Per the documented MCP contract — "You can only update and delete master items created using Qlik MCP tools." — `qlik_update_*` / `qlik_delete_*` can only act on items created via `qlik_create_*` within MCP. Pre-existing user-created items are read-only through MCP.
- **Published app restriction (platform-level, separate from the MCP rule):** In published apps (managed spaces), master-item edits must be made in the source app and re-published. This is a Qlik Sense rule and is independent of the MCP-only mutation restriction above.
- **Rename/delete propagation:** If a master measure is renamed or deleted, expressions referencing it by name return NULL rather than raising an error. References are not auto-updated.

### update_dimension / update_measure
- **MCP-only mutation rule:** Per the official server contract, only master items created via `qlik_create_dimension` / `qlik_create_measure` can be updated. Attempts to update pre-existing user-created items will fail.
- Useful for iterative scaffolding when an earlier `create_*` call produced an incorrect expression or label.

### delete_dimension / delete_measure
- **MCP-only mutation rule** applies identically (see above).
- References to a deleted master item by name return NULL silently at expression evaluation time (see rename/delete propagation note above).

## 4. Dataset and Catalog Tools

### search
- Searches applications, datasets, data products, and glossaries. Spaces and users are NOT searchable resource types via this tool.
- Use `resourceType` filter (e.g., "app,dataset") to narrow results.
- Paginated via `next` token.
- Resolving a space by name to a space ID is not available via the Qlik Cloud MCP server; obtain the ID from the Qlik Cloud UI (Spaces → space details URL) or the REST `/spaces` endpoint outside MCP. (Some other tools — e.g., `update_activate_data_product` — do accept a `spaceId` parameter; pre-resolve the ID before calling them.)

### get_dataset
- Returns the QRI (Qlik Resource Identifier) needed for `get_lineage`.
- Dataset types include QVD, CSV, and other Qlik-native formats.

### get_dataset_schema
- Data types are Qlik-native: STRING, DOUBLE, INTEGER, TIMESTAMP, DATE. These are not source database types.
- `primaryKey` flag may or may not be populated depending on how the dataset was registered.

### get_dataset_sample
- Fixed at 10 rows. No way to request more.

### get_dataset_profile
- Profile data may be stale or absent if the dataset hasn't been profiled recently.
- Check the profile timestamp. Use `update_dataset_quality` to trigger a fresh computation if needed.
- Not all datasets have profiles computed.

### get_dataset_freshness
- Returns last updated timestamp. No gotchas.

### get_dataset_trust_score
- **Returns an error when no trust score exists** (not null, not zero — an actual error). Most datasets won't have trust scores unless explicitly assessed. Handle this gracefully: log "trust score not available" and continue.

### get_dataset_memberships
- Returns which data products include this dataset. Paginated.

## 5. Lineage Tools

### get_lineage
- **One level deep per call.** Returns only immediate upstream dependencies.
- **Recursive calls required for full lineage.** For a pipeline like Source → Extract App → QVD → Transform App → Final App, you need 3+ calls.
- **QRI format must be exact:**
  - Apps: `qri:app:sense://[appId]`
  - Datasets: Get the QRI from `get_dataset` response (format varies).
- Not all resources have lineage metadata. Some apps or datasets may return empty results.

## 6. Governance Tools

### Glossary tools
- `update_term_status` accepts exactly `draft`, `verified`, or `deprecated` (case-sensitive).
- Only stewards can verify terms. Once verified, only stewards can modify the term.
- `get_full_glossary_export` is expensive — retrieves the entire glossary including all terms, categories, and links. Use `search_glossary_terms` for targeted queries instead.
- `create_glossary_term_links` supports both single and batch modes. When linking to subresources (field, master_dimension, master_measure), all three subresource fields (subResourceId, subResourceName, subResourceType) must be provided together.

### Data Product tools
- `update_data_product` uses patch operations for datasets, tags, and key contacts (op: add/remove/replace).
- `update_activate_data_product` requires name and spaceId. Activating makes the data product visible and consumable.
- `delete_data_product` is permanent and irreversible.

### Dataset metadata tools
- `update_dataset_quality` triggers an async computation. Returns a computation ID. Poll status with `get_dataset_quality_computation_status`.
- `update_dataset_metadata` uses patch operations for tags (op: add/remove/replace).
